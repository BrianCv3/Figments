# Figments
### The free hosting service I'm using is https://render.com/ 
### To use it create a new Webservice attach to a git repository (you should definitely make it a private one because you need to actually enter the API Keys into app.py and put it up there). 
### Select the closest region to you
### In "Build Command" enter this: pip install -r requirements.txt 
### In "Start Command" enter this: python app.py
### This isn't the best option for a host as you will need to reactivate the bot every 50 seconds of inactivity but was just the first free host I found.
### There are definitely better python program hosts, I just don't want to pay for them lol. You can ignore this if you're running the bot completely on your machine.
